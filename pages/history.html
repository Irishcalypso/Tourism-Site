        Galway, “The City of the Tribes”, was originally founded as a fishing village in the area close to the Spanish
        Arch, where the Corrib River flows into beautiful Galway Bay. The Normans came to Ireland in 1169 and began to
        occupy Connacht in the early 12th century.

        By the year 1232 it was held by the Anglo Normans under Richard de Burgo, but constant flying raids by the
        various Clans in the region brought about the need to build defensive walls. The work was commenced and it was
        an immense task given the small population of the town and the tools of the period. By 1270 much of the walls
        were in place including the Spanish Arch itself, and the town began to grow and prosper. A charter was granted
        in 1396 by Richard II which transferred governing powers to 14 merchant families, known locally as the 14 tribes
        of Galway. Each of the 14 tribes maintained a quasi-independence, while still retaining respectful links to the
        British crown. Galway City is now known and “City of The Tribes”, and the names of these fourteen tribes are now
        represented on roundabouts in Galway City.

        Early Times
        One of the earliest monuments is the Turoe Stone, near Loughrea. It is a granite stone featuring “La Tene”
        celtic art, and dates from c.200 B.C. This curvilinear art acts as a reminder of Ireland’s Celtic past when the
        La Tene Celts came from Switzerland to Ireland and brought with them language, writing, folklore and music.

        Ireland was celebrated as the Land of Saints and Scholars from the 5th to the 10th century, and Galway was no
        exception. Some of the Christian Saints in Galway included Saint Enda in Inishmore, St Columcille, St Feichin in
        Cong, St. Rock in Little Killary, and Saint Sourney in Inishmore.
