            It was occupied by the Anglo-Normans under Richard de Burgo until 1232.
            The various clans in the area built defensive walls. The work was tough, It was a tall
            order given the city's small population and the tools available at the time. About 1270 the wall was in
            place, including the Spanish Arch itself, the city began to grow and prosper.
            Richard II delegated the power of government to 14 merchant families, known locally as the 14 tribes
            from Galway. Each of the 14 tribes maintained independence while still maintaining a respectful
            relationship with the British crown. The city of Galway is known today as the "City of the Tribes",
            the names of the fourteen tribes are represented at the roundabout in Galway City.

                The earliest monuments is the Turoe Stone near Loughrea. It is a piece with
                "Latin" Celtic art, that dates back to 200 BC. This curvilinear art is reminiscent of Ireland's Celtic
                past if
                The Latène Celts came to Ireland from Switzerland, bringing with them language, writing, folklore and
                music.

                From the 5th century to the 10th century, Ireland was known as the land of saints and scholars, Galway
                No exception. Some of the Christian saints in Galway are Saint Enda of Inishmore, St Columcille, St
                Non-gold a Cong, St Rock at Little Killary and Saint Sourney at Inishmore.
                <br>
                The families had enormous influence in society in Galway and they had huge political power and
                wealth. Lynches castle is a prime example of their
                extravagance with elaborate stonework carved into the building, this was also their home.
